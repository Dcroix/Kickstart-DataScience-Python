# Kickstart Data Science with Python
## Trainer: Paolo Hilado MSc. (Data Science)
This repository contains all the essential files and resources for the Python training sessions I provide, including example scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and hypothetical datasets for hands-on practice. The materials focus on core Python concepts such as data loading, cleaning, manipulation, basic analysis using pandas and other built-in libraries, and sentiment analysis.
Feel free to explore, clone, and adapt the materials for your own learning or teaching — just don’t forget to credit the source if you reuse the content.
